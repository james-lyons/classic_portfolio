## Technologies Used:
HTML and CSS

## My Process and Approach
I started with the Monuments lab and the example portfolios provided as guides and then just styled it to look aesthetically pleasing and clean.

## Unsolved Problems
I didn't spend much time figuring out how to make the form to work. Using an API, like Mailchimp, would have been the way to go, but some are kind of awkward to set up (require business names and addresses?) and others seemd to create a worst user experience than having a link that opens up the mail app with my email preloaded.
