# Technologies Used:
°HTML and CSS

# My Process and Approach
I started with the Monuments lab and the example portfolios provided as guides and then just styled it to look aesthetically pleasing and clean.

# Unsolved Problems
I didn't spend much time figuring out how to make the form to work. Using an API like Mailchimp would have been the way to go but there are some that have a worst user experience than having a link that opens up the mail app with my email preloaded.
